## The Two Weeks Two Weeks Workshop

The idea is to generate a **simple app** each two weeks for the next couple of months, making it a kind of a diary for future exploration. :scroll:

Inspired by *Peter Levels*'  [12 startups in 12 months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) challenge and by Yahtzee's [dev diary](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAbMhAYRuCUibhDtVUn3WJnHojS2uSNPD), this a personal attempt at creating something fun and challenging to get some practice with some of the frontend technologies (and maybe more). 

The goal actually is **NOT** to complete the challenge, but to just having a time contstraint to finish at least the MVP in just two weeks and to have a framework for idea generation and exploration. :bulb:


- [ ] A weather App :umbrella:
- [ ] A chat service (chatter bot :robot:)
- [ ] Streaming platform (MVP) :computer:
> *More to add later ...* :sparkles:
